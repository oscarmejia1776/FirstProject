               Markup is text that has special meaning. By using things called "tags" one can change how text is portrayed on a page.<br>
               There are opening and closing tabs. Both of these along with text between them combine to form an element
          </p> 
          <p>
               For instance "em" makes text <em>italic</em> and "strong" makes text <strong>bold</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
               Writing an element using the tag "mark" will <mark>highlight</mark> the text. Using the tags <sub>"sub"</sub> and <sup>"sup"</sup> will be in reference to subscript or superscript.
          </p>
          <p>
               The only tag we've covered so far that is a "void tag" or "void element" is "br" or line break.

          <ol>
               <li>When making an ordered list you have to start with tag "ol"
               <li>Next you have to put "li" in front of each list item, but you don't need to put a closing tag.
               <li>You must close the list with the closing tag "/ol"
          </ol>
          <ul>
               <li>When making an unordered list, it works the same way as an ordered list but you must use the tag "ul"
               <li>The default for an unordered list is bullets, while ordered lists is numbers.
                    <ol>
                         <li>You can add lists within lists as well. But you mist remember to close the list.
                    </ol>
               <li>The elements so far that have closing tags are "p" and "li". "br" is still a void tag and only needs an opening.
          </ul>
          <p>
               If I write an opening tag of "p" but do not add a closing tag, it will still work because the next tag will signify the beginning a new piece of material.
